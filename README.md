# Worktron3000

This is a Python web application to provide a work-order like system for managing one's around the house tasks.
Say you do all the work around your house, and the people that you live in ask you to do things.
Continuing with our hypothetical, let's say that you'd like to see all your tasks in one view and also provide a place for those in your household to report things that you need to do around the house.
A situation similar to this hypothetical is the inspiration for me making this project.

<!-- ## Installation -->

<!-- Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection. -->

<!-- ## Usage -->

<!-- Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README. -->

## Roadmap

- [ ] nothing here, yet

<!-- ## Contributing -->

<!-- State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them. -->

<!-- For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self. -->

<!-- You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser. -->

<!-- ## Authors and acknowledgment -->

<!-- Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project. -->
